# Diamond Price Prediction

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the price of diamonds. The model is trained on a dataset of over 50,000 diamonds, and it can predict the price of a diamond.

## Getting Started
To use the model, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.6+

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

pickle

seaborn

matplotlib

streamlit

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can clone the repository and run the following command to run the web application :

python app.py

The model will output the predicted price of the diamond.

## Features
The model uses the following features to predict the price of a diamond:

CARAT WEIGHT: 'Carat weight refers to the size of the diamond, with 1 carat being equivalent to 200 milligrams.',

CUT : 'The cut refers to the shape and style of the diamond, which affects its brilliance and sparkle.',

COLOR : 'Diamond color is graded on a scale from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown). D is the most valuable and rarest color.',

CLARITY : 'Clarity measures the presence of internal and external flaws (inclusions and blemishes). It is graded on a scale from I3 (most visible) to IF (internally flawless).',

CUT QUALITY : 'Cut quality describes how well a diamond has been cut, determining its ability to reflect light.',

SYMNETRY : 'Symmetry refers to the alignment and balance of a diamond's facets.',

POLISH : 'Polish is a measure of the smoothness and quality of the diamond's surface.',

DEPTH PERCENT : 'Depth percent is the ratio of the depth of the diamond to its average width.',

TABLE PERCENT : 'Table percent is the ratio of the width of the diamond's top facet (table) to its average width.',

MEAS LENGTH : 'Measurement of the diamond's length in millimeters.',

MEAS WIDTH : 'Measurement of the diamond's width in millimeters.',

MEAS DEPTH : 'Measurement of the diamond's depth in millimeters.'

## Limitations:

The model is not perfect, and it can make mistakes. The following are some of the limitations of the model:

The model is only trained on a dataset of over 50,000 diamonds. This means that it may not be able to accurately predict the price of diamonds that are outside of the range of the data it was trained on.

it may not be able to accurately predict the price of diamonds that were sold in all countries.
